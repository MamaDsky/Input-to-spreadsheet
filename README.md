# InSheets (Input to Spreadsheets)

Simple Project created with HTML, CSS, JS programming languages. This project will run like an input form in general, the only difference here is that the output data will be entered into a Google Spreadsheet. In this project I also use sweetalert to help display "success" output

I am a student in high school who has an interest in the programming world and is trying to develop skills and experience. The languages â€‹â€‹I have learned are JS,PHP,C,Python . I will continue to develop my skills and knowledge until I feel satisfied, it seems like it will take a very long time because I am a person who is not easily satisfied with my achievements.
